- All stats, with every AA related obtained (planar power etc), gets you to 380 stat cap. (Heroic goes over, if you subtract the +# from the base value, if it's less than 380, normal stats improve you)

# STR

- 3 STR increases **offense** by 1
    - first 74 points of STR are not affected

    - if you fail a combine, halves the chance of skillup
    - if you have higher INT or WIS, they take precedence over STR and have a -15% penalty to skillup probability
    - tradeskill gains are a two-roll system. Stats impact the first roll only, and the second roll is based on your tradeskill level
