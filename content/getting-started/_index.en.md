##  GETTING STARTED / FIRST STEPS

  * This is a Multiclass server.  After you choose your initial class during character creation, you need to find a GM for the corresponding second and third classes. Use your "Bazaar Portal" AA, and all of the classes have a GM on the Northwest side of the zone.

  * After your three classes have been determined and assigned, go to the"Fading Memory" in the bazaar, and hand in your "Faded Writ". This will result in a weapon and piece of armor for each of your classes, as well as bags, and a Summoner's SynchroSatchel. The Summoner's SynchroSatchel can be put in your bank, and your pet will still utilize it.

  * Tearel will be able to port you to fast travel points you have found in the world, identified as glowing stones in a circle on the ground in key areas.

  * The "Bazaar and Back" AA when used will return you to the Bazaar and if used again, back to the point in the world you used it from. Make sure to put this on your hotbar right away. When you zone out of the bazaar, it will return you to wherever you were when you casted it. If you end up in the bazaar with no valid return destination, you will port to your bind point instead.

  * Once you selected your classes, get out there and kill some monsters!
