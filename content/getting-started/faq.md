## FAQ

> [!question]
> Can I reroll my classes if I dont like them?

Yes! For Echoes of Memory this service is available with a 7-day lockout, talk to the Vision of Ayonae in the Bazaar for more information.

> [!question]
> Some of my skills arent trainable, but still show up in the GM list with no level restriction?

All skills get automatically trained when you learn them, so no need to use a trainer, except for tradeskills, and you'll notice in the cases above it's a visual bug and can be safely ignored.


> [!question]
> I have X problem, and I need Cata/Aporia to look at it?

Do not ping them unless its game breaking, submit a bug-report in the discord, or ping the @Guide role depending on needs.


> [!question]
> Why cant I find items that dropped on Retribution or Pyrelight dropping at the same %?

The loot tables are based off of Project EQ right now, not specific to either of the other servers. Some resources are available such as [allaclone](<https://retributioneq.com/allaclone/>), [thjdi](<https://www.thjdi.cc/>) that can assist in querying the database.
